    My name is phillip and im 15 i like video games i hate the comapany wanerbros i hate school its the main cause of my depression im pretty ugly,
    no one really taught me how to love myself so most of the time i dont even love myself well all the time i dont love myself i have no self respect.
    i usally put others before me to insure there happy before im happy well im only happy sometimes its kinda rare for me to have a real smile most of the smiles
    people see me with is usally fake. I rarely vent to anyone i'd rather to keep it too myself and let it bottle up until i cant take it, and when people call me names
    i dont stop them because most of them true im gonna rate some of the names iv'e been called
    "Ugly" 10/10 ik im ugly thats why i wear a shiesty mask
    "i hate you" 10/10 i hate me too
    "uncaring" 0/10 i do care about others just not myself
    "why do you exist?" 10/10 ion know myself
    Sometimes people ask me who is your worst enemy and i be like myself then they looked confused (they dont understand)
    i sometimes question why God even bother to wake me up anymore its really confusing i dont want him to waste his time on me
